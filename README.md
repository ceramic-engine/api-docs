# ceramic-docs

A ceramic project used to generate ceramic API docs.

Look at the resulting docs here: https://ceramic-engine.com/api/

## Requirements

- Node.js and ceramic installed on the machine
- A Unix computer (Mac or Linux. Windows is not supported).

## Usage

Install node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, generate documentation by running:

```bash
./gen-docs.sh
```

This should create a `docs/` folder with generated html files using your current ceramic installation.
